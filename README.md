# LiteImage
Lightweight image implementation for most common tasts: mainly for algorithms prototyping.
* Plain, simple and stupid as hammer
* pitch-linear data layout
* Close-to-shaders usage sematics
* understandable by [kernel_slicer](https://github.com/Ray-Tracing-Systems/kernel_slicer), i.e. support automatic translation from C++ to GLSL
* Native load/stote support for '.ppm','.bmp' and plain binary formats (line '.image4f') 
* Optional load/stote support for '.png' and '.jpg' via stb_image (-DUSE_STB_IMAGE=ON)

# Examples
TBD
